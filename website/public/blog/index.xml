      <description>Welcome to my blog Hello World,&#xA;My name is Thang I come from Vietnam, I have been working as Software Developer for a Core Insurance Provider in Germany. At first, I move to Germany for pursuing my Master&amp;rsquo;s degree and earning more hands-on experience. Luckily, I had a chance to start as an Intern at tech11 GmbH - a Core Insurance Platform Provider located in WÃ¼rzburg city, where I really have a chance to apply what I have learned to realworld problems and I also have a playground to learn and to grow there.</description>
