# Welcome to my blog

Hello World,

My name is Thang I come from Vietnam, I have been working as Software Developer for a Core Insurance Provider in Germany. At first, I move to Germany for pursuing my Master's degree and earning more hands-on experience. Luckily, I had a chance to start as an Intern at tech11 GmbH - a Core Insurance Platform Provider located in WÃ¼rzburg city, where I really have a chance to apply what I have learned to realworld problems and I also have a playground to learn and to grow there.

For long time, I have been thinking of making a blog page where I can share a bit about myself and also a few interesting things that I experience during my working or some of my thoughts.
So I started making my hand dirty on that during holidays time and then BAMB! It's there now.

So I came up with an idea for this page is to introduce a bit about my professional skills, some technical topics that I find them interesting and to really "save" them into my head by sharing. Sometimes, I have thoughts about career path, things that I experienced, and some life and workplace lessons that I would like to share first for reminding myself and then share to the world and with a bit of luck that might help you one day.

So long story short, I am glad that you visit my little page and enjoy a good read. Thank you and happy coding or...anything you like to ;)!
