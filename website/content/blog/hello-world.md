At first, I move to Germany for pursuing my Master's degree and earning more hands-on experience. Luckily, I had a chance to start as an Intern at tech11 GmbH - a Core Insurance Platform Provider located in WÃ¼rzburg city, where I really have a chance to apply what I have learned to realworld problems and I also have a playground to learn and to grow there.

For long time, I have been thinking of making a blog page where I can share a bit about myself and also a few interesting things that I experience during my working or some of my thoughts.
So I started making my hand dirty on that during holidays time and then BAMB! It's there now.
